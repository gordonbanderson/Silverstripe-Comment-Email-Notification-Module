Email Notification of Comments
==============================

To install this module execute the following in your web root:

    git clone git://github.com/gordonbanderson/Silverstripe-Comment-Email-Notification-Module.git

You can rename the folder to anything you like as there are no javascript or CSS dependencies.

When a comment is made on a page, the administrator of the site will now be emailed to let them know a comment has been made.  No further configuration is required :)
