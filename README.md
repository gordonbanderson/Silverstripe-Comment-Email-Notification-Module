#Email Notification of Comments

Please note that I will no longer be mainting this module, https://github.com/tractorcow/silverstripe-comments-notifications offers more configurability.

#Install

To install this module execute the following in your web root:

    git clone git://github.com/gordonbanderson/Silverstripe-Comment-Email-Notification-Module.git

You can rename the folder to anything you like as there are no javascript or CSS dependencies.

When a comment is made on a page, the administrator of the site will now be emailed to let them know a comment has been made.  No further configuration is required :)
